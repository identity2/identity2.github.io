Remote Teaching due to COVID19
Instructor: Prof. Tien-Tsin Wong
Grading Scheme  Programming assignments x 4 (100%)  Topics Covered  Multimedia digital representation Compression algorithms View synthesis  Review Usually, this course contains a group project where students work on a P2P music streaming desktop application. However, this year, since it was online teaching, we only needed to turn in 4 programming assignments. They weren&amp;rsquo;t difficult concept-wise, but just really tricky to implement correctly since they involved some amount of 3D math.</description>

Remote Teaching due to COVID19
Grading Scheme  Resume writing (15%) Cover letter writing(20%) Business letter writing (25%) Mock individual interview (25%) Mock group interview (15%)  Review This is the third and final English requirement for engineering majors.

The first part of the course was resume writing and business writing. It was very easy but I don&amp;rsquo;t think the marking scheme was fair. The teacher required us to &amp;ldquo;elaborate&amp;rdquo; on every points beneath a listing, however, I believe most of the companies prefer short and concise bullet points rather than long elaborations.</description>
