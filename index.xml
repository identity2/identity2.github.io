      <description>I was hunting for a new grad software engineering role over the last few months and quite fortunately, Google invited me for a technical phone interview one week after I submitted my resume through their job portal. I will write down the full process of my application in this article. Verbosely.

My application process, ordered chronologically:
 Technical Phone Interview x 1 Virtual On-site Interviews (Technical x 4 + Behavioral x 1) Team-matching Fit Talks x 3 (Matched with one of the team) Hiring Committee Review Additional Technical Interviews x 2 (Requested by the Hiring Committee) Hiring Committee Re-evaluation Onboarding  Technical Phone Interview I was called by a Googler from the Taipei Office for my technical phone interview.</description>

Remote Teaching due to COVID19
Instructor: Prof. Tien-Tsin Wong
Grading Scheme  Programming assignments x 4 (100%)  Topics Covered  Multimedia digital representation Compression algorithms View synthesis  Review Usually, this course contains a group project where students work on a P2P music streaming desktop application. However, this year, since it was online teaching, we only needed to turn in 4 programming assignments. They weren&amp;rsquo;t difficult concept-wise, but just really tricky to implement correctly since they involved some amount of 3D math.</description>

Grading Scheme  Resume writing (15%) Cover letter writing(20%) Business letter writing (25%) Mock individual interview (25%) Mock group interview (15%)  Review This is the third and final English requirement for engineering majors.

The first part of the course was resume writing and business writing. It was very easy but I don&amp;rsquo;t think the marking scheme was fair. The teacher required us to &amp;ldquo;elaborate&amp;rdquo; on every points beneath a listing, however, I believe most of the companies prefer short and concise bullet points rather than long elaborations.</description>

      <title>Proving NP-Completeness by Restriction</title>

      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2019 21:29:47 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://shinerightstudio.com/posts/prove-np-complete-by-restriction/</guid>
      <description>Proving NP-Completeness is a core topic in the studies of algorithms. For most of the algorithms textbooks, they show some complicated tricks which reduce a known NP-Complete problem to another problem, say Q, to prove that Q is NP-Complete. This works because if problem A reduces to problem B, then B is at least as difficult as A. And since A is NP-Complete, B is also NP-Complete.

However, many problem reduction methods are extremely subtle and often require some &amp;ldquo;divine instincts&amp;rdquo; to come up with in the first place.</description>

      <description>Lore Keshia Erasia was once the happiest eraser in the world. His owner Bobby had always placed him inside an exquisite aluminum box after using him. Though becoming smaller everyday, Keshia still enjoyed the time with Bobby…until one day, Bobby tripped on a crossbar and dropped his aluminum box on the sidewalk. The pain was enough for Bobby to forget the aluminum box and left. Keshia thus became just another forsaken rubbish on the side walk.</description>

      <description>Lore Othox Codox was once a magic codex written by the famous sorcerer Bobbington. Unfortunately, Bobbington was executed because he stole a loaf of bread. All Bobbington’s precious publications were torn and ripped, some burnt in the merciless flames. Othox, though almost ripped into shreds, called for the Blessings of Rabimouchinus and granted a wheel chair to aid him. He practiced the magic written inside him as he ran away from the murderers and gradually became one of the greatest magic codex in the world.</description>

      <description>Lore Ranawato Plato was once the most beloved plate of a famous philosopher, Bobus. As bad luck would have it, Bobus committed suicide due to the pain of existence. Ranawato then became an unused plate on the shelf (aka. rubbish). Overwhelmed by sad emotions, Ranawato dreamed of her deceased owner every night…until one day, a handsome spoon came and introduced himself. Ranawato thus forgot her past owner and ran away with the spoon.</description>

However, smart phones became a thing and they were thrown into the recycle bin by their owner Bobs. They joined the local gang inside the bin and became the SS brothers (even though they had no genetic ties). The gang leader Big Brother had good relationship with the founder of Knights Rubbish, Keshia Erasia, so he referred the SS brothers to Keshia.</description>

      <description>Lore Wendy Floopy was once the 6th installation floppy disk of a famous operating system. However, then came CDs, USB drives, and well, cloud downloads as replacements of floppies, so her owner Bobates the Software Engineer tossed her in the recycling box without another glimpse. Bored, Wendy’s biggest interest became collecting CDs in the recycling box.

One day, Keshia Erasia, the founder of Knights Rubbish happened to pass by and fall in love with Wendy, but Wendy refused Keshia because he is ugly.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, I wrote an article about some camera moving schemes used in Metal Slug 3. In this article, I will show you how to actually implement such a camera.

I will be using the open source Godot Engine with GDScript since I believe any programmer with could understand GDScript quite easily, so let&amp;rsquo;s get started.

First, let&amp;rsquo;s define some variables we&amp;rsquo;ll use later.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started to work on my first 2D side scrolling platformer recently. However, before diving into designing my own game, I did some quick research on various topics about 2D platformers. One of them is camera controlling (aka. scene scrolling).

I find some interesting camera controlling technique used in the Metal Slug series, so I would like to share my observations and analysis of how and when to apply those camera controlling schemes.</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve started my beatbox rhythm game project Boots-Cut using Unity. When prototyping the basic game mechanics, I found that it is quite tricky to sync the music notes with the music correctly. However, there are very little articles on the web concerning this subject. So, I will try to point out some important tips when developing a rhythm game (especially in Unity) in this article.

Among all, I found the following three points with most importance:</description>
