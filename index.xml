      <description>Just participated in my very first Capture the Flag (CTF) competition two weeks ago. I had never heard of CTF before I took the cybersecurity course this semester, and it didn’t interest me at first so I didn’t register for it until a friend of mine invited me to join his team. It turned out to be a fabulous experience.

Usually, CTF competitions can be classified into two types, namely, the “attack and defense” match where two teams battle by attacking and defending a server, and the “jeopardy” contest where multiple teams compete to solve tricky puzzles.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t get an internship this summer. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t because of COVID-19 or failing interviews, I simply didn&amp;rsquo;t apply to any. I felt that since I would be working something like 9-to-5 for the next 20, 30, or 40 years after I graduate, why would I spend my last summer vacation on&amp;hellip;working? So, instead of going through the anxiety of internship searching, I designed a few side projects and started working on them.</description>

The first part of the course was resume writing and business writing. It was very easy but I don&amp;rsquo;t think the marking scheme was fair. The teacher required us to &amp;ldquo;elaborate&amp;rdquo; on every points beneath a listing, however, I believe most of the companies prefer short and concise bullet points rather than long elaborations.</description>

      <description>In this semester, I am taking a course called Principles of Programming Language. It introduced some interesting programming language concepts such as dynamic scoping, duck typing, functional programming, and logic programming. However, what I enjoyed most in the course is that I got a lot of chance to explore and compare drastically different languages. In a 13-week semester, we had to turn in assignments written in COBOL, C, Java, Python, Perl, Prolog, and ML.</description>

      <guid>https://YuChaoGithub.github.io/posts/prove-np-complete-by-restriction/</guid>
      <description>Proving NP-Completeness is a core topic in the studies of algorithms. For most of the algorithms textbooks, they show some complicated tricks which reduce a known NP-Complete problem to another problem, say Q, to prove that Q is NP-Complete. This works because if problem A reduces to problem B, then B is at least as difficult as A. And since A is NP-Complete, B is also NP-Complete.

However, many problem reduction methods are extremely subtle and often require some &amp;ldquo;divine instincts&amp;rdquo; to come up with in the first place.</description>

Though I publish mostly technical or game dev articles on this blog, I really enjoyed the materials in the course and I&amp;rsquo;d love to share the basics (that is, the terminology) of the course here. (Note we refer &amp;ldquo;music in film&amp;rdquo; as the score music of films rather than the sound effects.)

      <description>Haven&amp;rsquo;t been writing articles for almost half a year because I got back to school this spring. It&amp;rsquo;s really difficult to handle both the course works and side projects (such as maintaining a blog) at the same time, and I&amp;rsquo;m starting to worry that I&amp;rsquo;ll have even less time writing after I graduate. The &amp;ldquo;harsh&amp;rdquo; reality and &amp;ldquo;tough&amp;rdquo; life often change our hobbies into more &amp;ldquo;entertainment&amp;rdquo; ones unlike writing or other creative activities.</description>

      <description>Below is a list of all the courses I&amp;rsquo;ve taken during my university studies at CUHK (The Chinese University of Hong Kong).

      <description>My second game project Knights Rubbish has released!

Originally I was just doing some experiments with Godot Engine and trying to implement the bare bones of a platformer, but then the project grew larger and larger as I combined it with other mechanics I was testing. After a year and couple of months, Knights Rubbish was born!
Real Photos as Game Graphics One of the coolest features in Knights Rubbish is that most of its graphics are made with processed photos.</description>

      <description>Lore Keshia Erasia was once the happiest eraser in the world. His owner Bobby had always placed him inside an exquisite aluminum box after using him. Though becoming smaller everyday, Keshia still enjoyed the time with Bobby…until one day, Bobby tripped on a crossbar and dropped his aluminum box on the sidewalk. The pain was enough for Bobby to forget the aluminum box and left. Keshia thus became just another forsaken rubbish on the side walk.</description>

      <description>Lore Othox Codox was once a magic codex written by the famous sorcerer Bobbington. Unfortunately, Bobbington was executed because homosexuality wasn’t legal then. All Bobbington’s precious publications were torn and ripped, some burnt in the merciless flames. Othox, though almost ripped into shreds, called for the Blessings of Rabimouchinus and granted a wheel chair to aid him. He practiced the magic written inside him as he ran away from the murderers and gradually became one of the greatest magic codex in the world.</description>

      <description>Lore Ranawato Plato was once the most beloved plate of a famous philosopher, Bobus. As bad luck would have it, Bobus committed suicide due to the pain of existence. Ranawato then became an unused plate on the shelf (aka. rubbish). Overwhelmed by sad emotions, Ranawato dreamed of her deceased owner every night…until one day, a handsome spoon came and introduced himself. Ranawato thus forgot her past owner and ran away with the spoon.</description>

However, smart phones became a thing and they were thrown into the recycle bin by their owner Bobs. They joined the local gang inside the bin and became the SS brothers (even though they had no genetic ties). The gang leader Big Brother had good relationship with the founder of Knights Rubbish, Keshia Erasia, so he referred the SS brothers to Keshia.</description>

      <description>Lore Wendy Floopy was once the 6th installation floppy disk of a famous operating system. However, then came CDs, USB drives, and well, cloud downloads as replacements of floppies, so her owner Bobates the Software Engineer tossed her in the recycling box without another glimpse. Bored, Wendy’s biggest interest became collecting CDs in the recycling box.

One day, Keshia Erasia, the founder of Knights Rubbish happened to pass by and fall in love with Wendy, but Wendy refused Keshia because he is ugly.</description>

      <description>I just self-published my very first graphic novel Inter-dimensional Time recently, using Amazon&amp;rsquo;s KDP (Kindle Direct Publish) platform. In this article, I am going to share my experience with Amazon KDP, and briefly go through the process of self-publishing.
Introduction Amazon KDP is arguably the cheapest and most convenient self-publishing service out there. It requires no service fee and lets you publish your book in both eBook and paperback formats. The best part, as far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned, is that the dimensions, paper material, cover art, and pricing are highly customizable.</description>

      <description>I made an iOS Tuner &amp;amp; Metronome App last couple of months due to boredom. Suffering from boredom again this month, I decided to write an article on how I implement it.

In this article, I will show:
 How to sample audio from the microphone using AudioKit. How to calculate the notes from raw frequencies (of the sampled audio).  
I will not delve into how I implement the views since the code is quite bulky and tedious.</description>

      <description>I.Introduction: The Coin Tossing Problem Whenever you have difficulty deciding something, for example, whether to attend the lectures of a course or not, the most common thing to do in this scenario is to toss a coin and see whether the heads or tails of the coin is facing up when they land. Assume that the coin you toss is uniform, meaning that the chance of the heads to land facing up is equal to the chance of the tails to land facing up.</description>

Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve been moving my blog around different platforms quite a bit this year. Within only 8 months I&amp;rsquo;ve switched from Google&amp;rsquo;s Blogger to a self hosted Ghost blog on an AWS server, and now, I moved all my articles on my AWS server to this new blog, using Hugo static page generator, hosted on GitHub.

The reason why I switched to Hugo on GitHub is quite simple.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, I wrote an article about some camera moving schemes used in Metal Slug 3. In this article, I will show you how to actually implement such a camera.

I will be using the open source Godot Engine with GDScript since I believe any programmer with could understand GDScript quite easily, so let&amp;rsquo;s get started.

First, let&amp;rsquo;s define some variables we&amp;rsquo;ll use later.

      <title>Camera Moving Scene Scrolling in Metal Slug 3</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started to work on my first 2D side scrolling platformer recently. However, before diving into designing my own game, I did some quick research on various topics about 2D platformers. One of them is camera controlling (aka. scene scrolling).

I find some interesting camera controlling technique used in the Metal Slug series, so I would like to share my observations and analysis of how and when to apply those camera controlling schemes.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve already posted an article about Google Summer of Code 2017. However, the post is mainly about the project itself. For this article, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my experience and thoughts for the whole GSoC period.
 Google Summer of Code 2017 was an extremely exciting and rewarding experience for me. I was very lucky to be accepted by Systers (Anita Borg Institute) for working on the PowerUp-iOS project.</description>

      <description>Apple&amp;rsquo;s Sprite Kit is a really well-designed and convenient framework for iOS game development. In this article, I will briefly introduce Sprite Kit Action (SKAction in short), which is the bread and butter for animating nodes in Sprite Kit.
The Basics In Sprite Kit, every node can run an SKAction by calling the run(_:) function. run(_:) takes an SKAction as its parameter, and will perform the action immediately after the call.</description>

      <description>After finishing 2 of my projects in Unity, I was planning to try out something different and hopefully, more suitable for me to use. I did a quick research on some modern cross platform game engines: Godot, Cocos2d-x, Atomic, Love2D, Phaser, and of course, Unreal. I finally decided to look more into Godot Engine. In this article, I will write briefly about the features, the special node-scene system, as well as the pros and cons of Godot Engine.</description>

      <description>Testing your code is a vital process in app development, since it could reveal bugs and mistakes before the users actually use it. However, testing your app whenever you make a commit can be tedious and time-consuming. This is where Continuous Integration (CI) comes to rescue.
Continuous Integration Continuous Integration is the process of building and testing your app automatically, saving precious time for the developers. In this article, I will demonstrate how to integrate Travis CI to your XCode projects (to be specific, iOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS projects) on GitHub.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to participate in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) someday. Fortunately, this year, I got selected by Systers, an Anita Borg Institute community for a mobile game project &amp;ndash; PowerUp. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll write about how I chose which project to contribute, how I wrote my proposal, and what is the PowerUp project about.
Selecting Organizations When selecting which organizations to contribute, I focus mostly on what am I capable of doing, what interests me the most, and which projects would enhance my portfolio for my dream career.</description>

      <description>中文版 (Chinese Version)

Finally finished reading the famous &amp;ldquo;The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses&amp;rdquo; by Jesse Schell. Jesse Schell is a professor at CMU ETC (which happens to be my dream graduate school :D) and an experienced game designer. Throughout the book, he often explains some abstract concepts by his actual experience in game designing (especially from the game Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for Buccaneer Gold and Toontown Online which he designed) and performance art (he was a juggler during his teenage years).</description>

      <description>Using particle systems is a wonderful way to improve the juiciness as well as the aesthetics of your game.

When making my rhythm game Boots-Cuts, I used the particle system in Unity to display a little firework effect whenever a music note is hit on-beat.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate how to make such an effect.
Texture and Material First, we&amp;rsquo;ll have to import the the graphics which we would like the particle systems to emit (aka.</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve started my beatbox rhythm game project Boots-Cut using Unity. When prototyping the basic game mechanics, I found that it is quite tricky to sync the music notes with the music correctly. However, there are very little articles on the web concerning this subject. So, I will try to point out some important tips when developing a rhythm game (especially in Unity) in this article.

Among all, I found the following three points with most importance:</description>

      <description>Just published my Recordable Launchpad app on the iOS App Store and Google Play! Actually, the project was created accidentally when I was testing out Unity In-App Purchase, Google Admob Unity SDK, the &amp;ldquo;Prepare iOS for Recording&amp;rdquo; checkbox, and Audio Latency.

Since integrating Unity In-App Purchase and Google Admob are rather straightforward, I would be writing mostly about (the more troublesome parts, which are)
 Serializing and Deserializing AudioClips Getting Rid of Audio Latency Prepare iOS for Recording and iPhoneSpeakerFix  in this article.</description>
